 LINEAR SEARCH:

AIM: To implement linear search om a array.

Algorithm: 
1. Start at the first element (index 0) of the list.

2. Compare the current element with the target value you are searching for.

3. If the current element matches the target value, the search is successful. Return the index of the current element and stop.

4. If the current element does not match the target value, move to the next element in the list.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire list has been checked.

If the entire list has been searched and the target value was not found, the search is unsuccessful. return statement "the element is not present".

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, key, flag = 0;

    printf("Enter number of elements: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];

    printf("Enter %d elements:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    printf("Enter the element to search: ");
    scanf("%d", &key);

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == key) {
            flag = 1;   // found
            printf("Element %d found at position %d\n", key, i + 1);
            break;  
        }
    }

    if (flag == 0) {
        printf("Element %d not found in the array\n", key);
    }

    return 0;
}
